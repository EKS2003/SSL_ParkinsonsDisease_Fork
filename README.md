# Parkinson's Disease Movement Data

This project is part of the Smart Systems Laboratory at the University of Florida and focuses on developing a machine learning-based assessment tool for Parkinson's disease. The objective is to analyze patient movement data to detect and quantify tremors, enabling more precise assessments. By leveraging computer vision and data-driven methodologies, the system tracks motion patterns and applies feature extraction techniques to evaluate motor symptoms.
